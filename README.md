`cpm-gen` is an auto-matic provenance generation tool for a machine-learning pipeline
stored in MLflow. The pipeline is applied for use in digital pathol-
ogy, where a machine-learning model is trained for carcinoma cell
detection in high-resolution images of the human prostate.
The solution is implemented as a modular and extensible Java
codebase, which is incorporated into an application demonstrating its
use.

This project was implemented in the scope of my Master's thesis (https://is.muni.cz/th/uo0m2/).
